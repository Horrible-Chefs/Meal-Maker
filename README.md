Turning Ideas Into Reality

## Problem Statement
* What customers can cook with the ingredients they already have?
* What couldâ€™ve they cooked with just one or two extra ingredients?

## Customers
* Mainly Students and professionals who live alone, use cookbooks and looking for a quick fix

## Horrible Chefs:
* Munaf Arshad Qazi
* Jayesh Kishor Mhatre
* Siddhartha Arora
* Niha Jasmin Habul
* Farhan Hasan

## Tech-Stuff & Citations
* The Recipe Knowledgebase has been deployed on an mLab MongoDB instance. Credentials can be acquired from maqzi incase someone needs to access it.
* Java-Mongo-Driver-3.4 (for android by matfur92) was used to connect to the server. It can be forked from [matfur92's github](https://github.com/matfur92/mongo-java-driver).
* ServerTester 1.0 can be downloaded, studied and run directly on Android Studio, I've uploaded the complete source code. You'll just need the username, password and database name. 

## Testing & Troubleshooting
* Make sure you have entered the username, password and dbname in SearchEngine.Class.
* Make sure you have something in the SQLite Database. You can use the commented stubs in MyPantry.Class to add/remove a test record until AddMore.Class is implemented.
